Problem Statement:
Guddu and Golu were tired of thinking how to conquer mirzapur so they thought of playing  a simple game to clear their mind.
It is a board game that they designed consisting of linear arrangement of n+1 boxes numbered 0 to n left to right.
      There is one token(playing piece) that is initially placed at n th box.(rightmost)
      Each player alternatively take turns in making their move of the common token.
In each turn, a player can move 1,3 or k boxes to the left. The token must not leave the board. The player who cant make a move loses. Can you predict who will win if Golu makes the first move? (Both Golu and Guddu are extremely intelligent and play the optimum move).

Input format:
First line contains t testcases.
Next t lines contain two integers n and k.

Constraints:
1<=t<=100
0<=n<=10^9 , 3<k <=10^9

Output:
Print “Guddu” if he wins or “Golu”(without quotes) in new lines

Sample:
