SIMPLY Digits.

Problem Statement : Given an integer N(0<N<power(10,18)) and take an empty string s. 
           Append numbers from 1 to N without leading zeros to s. Calculate the length of string s.
           As the length of string will be very high calculate length modulo 1000000007

example: N=5, then s=12345.

length of s=5.

Constraints : 0<N<power(10,18);

Expected Solution and time complexity : For single digits we know that length of s is N. 
For numbers with digit greater than 1, example: N=15, s=123456789101112131415. length of s=21. 
Similarly, if x is the number of digits in N then length of string 
s = sigma (i = (1 to x-1)){(9*i*( power(10,i-1) ) }+((N- sigma(i=(1 to x-1){(9 (power(10,i-1))})*x)


To calculate number of digits we have time complexity log(N) to base 10.
 And then for sigma we go log(N) times in loop. So 2 * log(N), which is O( log(N) ).
