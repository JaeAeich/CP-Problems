Problem Statement: Given a 9x9 grid consisting of only zeros and ones. The number of ones in the grid will not be greater than 8. There should be exactly nine '1's in the grid.

You have to determine if you can find the exact positions where missing 1's
can replace '0's without any ambiguity (i.e. there is only one possible way to arrange the '1's) following the rules of solving a Sudoku. (Every horizontal and vertical line should contain exactly one '1'. Also, nine 3x3 boxes as shown in link below should contain exactly one '1'.)

It is guaranteed that the 1's present the grid will follow the rules of Sudoku.

If you don't know what a Sudoku is, you can read about it https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku.

Constraint: Number of 1's in the grid will not exceed 8.

Input: 9 binary strings

Output: If it is impossible to determine the remaining 1's, just print "NO".
If it is possible to determine the remaining 1's, print "YES" in the first line and each next line will contain the position of remaining ones.
eg: i) NO
ii) YES
2 4
3 3

Expected Difficulty level: Easy-Medium

Expected Solution: It is easy to notice that we can determine the position of remaining 1's if and only if there are 8 1's already present in the grid. Eg: if seven '1's are given there will always be two possible ways to arrange the '1's.

So, if number of 1's in the grid are less than 8, simply print "NO".

To determine the position of last 1, we will find the row number and column number in the grid which does not contain 1 by iterating over the grid 2 times.

Time Compexity: O(81+81) = O(100).
